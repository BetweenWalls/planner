Path of Diablo Planner

* Click on the character's level or class to change them
* Use right click to remove points or items
* Shift and ctrl modify the amount added or removed
* Upgrading can be done by ctrl-clicking the equipped item (ctrl + right-click to downgrade)

Current Known Issues:
* Charms can't be moved into a new space below the original space if they overlap eachother
* Shift + Right Click in Firefox doesn't work (and still opens the default menu)
* Enhanced Defense from corruptions or socketed Pul Runes is applied to all armor instead of just that item
* Socketed gems/runes/jewels sometimes aren't aligned like they should be
* Upgrading/Downgrading:
	* Allowed for any item (instead of just rare/unique)
	* Required level/strength/dexterity may be inaccurate
	* Unimplemented: quest weapons
* Unimplemented: mercenary stats
* Unimplemented: offhand damage for select skills (Frenzy, Whirlwind, Dual Strike)
* Unimplemented: skill buffs from item-charges
* Unimplemented: option to 'snapshot' buffs
* Unimplemented: breakpoint info for FCR, FBR, FHR
* Breakpoints for IAS (frames-per-attack) may be inaccurate
* Some stats from offhand weapons may incorrectly contribute to mainhand attacks (and vice versa)

This project will likely be made open-source at some point, but if you want to contribute directly before that point, any improvements would be welcome.
